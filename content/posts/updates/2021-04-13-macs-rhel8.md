The GW4 Isambard **Multi-Architecture Comparison System** will be unavailable for the week of the **19th April** to perform planned upgrades & maintenance of the software stack.

This is a major software upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, bringing the Operating System major version inline with the A64FX service, it will provide a better base for software development and improve the MACS compatibility with scientific software, including the Cray software stack.

Some user software compatibility issues are to be expected due to changed/updated libraries, so recompilations may be required to continue running on MACS.

XCI & A64FX remain available during this time.
