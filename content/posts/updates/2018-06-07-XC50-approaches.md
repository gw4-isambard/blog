The single cabinet consists of approx 164 compute nodes of 64 cores each, for a total of 10'496 cores of Cavium Thunder X2 ARMv8, backed by the same Aries interconnect. A 0.5 Petabyte Lustre filesystem is dedicated to the Isambard system.

Discussions are underway on acceptance tests, we expect to run HPL (LINPACK), HPCG, STREAM, MPI & I/O benchmarks. Some practical codes will also be run for comparison against the numbers produced on the Early Access nodes ( <http://www.goingarm.com/slides/2017/SC17/GoingArm_SC17_Bristol_Isambard.pdf> ), including UM/NEMO, a chemistry and an engineering code.
 
The HPC group at Bristol Uni has recently put out a paper on these numbers in more depth: <https://uob-hpc.github.io/assets/cug-2018.pdf>
